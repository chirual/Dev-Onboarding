# Use autoscale to adjust compute resources

## Introduction

In this tutorial, you'll build a load-balanced web application that can automatically scale out/in based on CPU utilization.  

In this tutorial, you'll create a load balancer, compute instance, instance configuration, and then configure auto-scaling. You'll then verify auto-scaling feature as a configured threshold on CPU is crossed.

Autoscaling enables you to automatically adjust the number of compute instances in an instance pool based on performance metrics, such as CPU utilization. This helps you provide consistent performance for your end-users during periods of high demand, and helps you reduce your costs during periods of low demand.

You select a performance metric to monitor and set thresholds that the performance metric must reach to trigger an autoscaling event. When system usage meets a threshold, autoscaling dynamically allocates resources in near-real time. As load increases, instances are automatically provisioned: the instance pool scales out. As load decreases, instances are automatically removed: the instance pool scales in.

Autoscaling relies on performance metrics that are collected by the Monitoring service. These performance metrics are aggregated into one-minute time periods and then averaged across the instance pool. When three consecutive values (that is, the average metrics for three consecutive minutes) meet the threshold, an autoscaling event is triggered.

A cooldown period between autoscaling events lets the system stabilize at the updated level. The cooldown period starts when the instance pool reaches a steady state. Autoscaling continues to evaluate performance metrics during the cooldown period. When the cooldown period ends, autoscaling adjusts the instance pool's size again if needed.

## Create your VCN and Subnets

Set up a VCN to connect your Linux instance to the internet. You will configure all the components needed to create your virtual network.

1. Open the navigation menu. Under Core Infrastructure, go to Networking and click **Virtual Cloud Networks**.

    Ensure that a compartment (or the compartment designated for you) is selected in the Compartment list on the left.

2. Click **Start VCN Wizard**.

3. Select VCN with Internet Connectivity, and then click **Start VCN Wizard**.

4. Enter the following (descriptions are italicized. replace with the values for your scenario):

	* Name: *Enter a name for your cloud network*
	* COMPARTMENT: *select the desired compartment*
	* VCN CIDR BLOCK: *10.0.0.0/16*
	* PUBLIC SUBNET CIDR BLOCK: *10.0.0.0/24*
	* PRIVATE SUBNET CIDR BLOCK: *10.0.1.0/24*
	* DNS RESOLUTION: *checked*

   **Note**: The public and private subnets have different CIDR blocks.

4. Click Next. 

    The Create a VCN with Internet Connection configuration dialog will be displayed, confirming all the values you just entered and listing additional components that will be created.

5. Click **Create** to start the workflow.

This will create a VCN with the following components:

    *VCN, Public subnet, Private subnet, Internet gateway (IG), NAT gateway (NAT), Service gateway (SG)*


6. After the workflow completes, click on **View Virtual Cloud Networks** and you will be directed to the details page of the VCN you created.

    ![](images-sandbox/create_autoscaling_configuration03.png " ")

22. Click **Next**, revieww the information and click **Create**.

## Test the setup

1. In the load balancer details, look at the Public IP of the Load Balancer and open in the web browser.

2. Back in the OCI console, Under **Compute**, click **Instance Pools**, and then your pool name. Click **Created Instances**, you should see a compute instance created. Click the Compute Instance name.


3. In the terminal where you saved yout priate key, ssh to the instance 

    ```
    ssh -i <private_key> opc@<PUBLIC_IP_OF_COMPUTE>
    ```

4. Now start CPU stress, Enter command:

    ```
    sudo stress --cpu 4 --timeout 350
    ```

    *Spawn 4 workers spinning with a timeout of 350 seconds.*

5. Switch back to OCI console and navigate to Instance Pool Details page. Scroll down to **Metric** screen, you should see CPU spiking up after a minute or so.
    ![](images-sandbox/autoscaling_up01.png " ")

6. In about 3-5 minutes (time configured when we created auto scale configuration), status of Pool should change to **Scaling** and a second compute instance should launch. Click on **Work Requests and you will see the work request that will create a new instance.
    ![](images-sandbox/autoscaling_up02.png " ")

    *This is since our criteria of CPU utilization > 10 was met.*

7. When the second instance is up and running and the instance pool status is 'Running', switch to the web browser and refresh the page multiple times and observe the load balancer balancing traffic between the two web servers.

8. Switch back to the terminal and if the stress tool is still running, click Ctrl + C to stop the script.

9. Switch back to OCI console window and navigate to your compute instance details page. Verify CPU utilization goes down after a minute.
    
10. Navigate to Instance pool details page and after 3-4 minute Instance pool status will change to **Scaling** . Additional compute instance will be deleted.
    ![](images-sandbox/autoscaling_up03.png " ")

    *This is because our criteria of CPU utilization < 5 is met.*

## Delete Resources

1. Switch to  OCI console window.

2. Open the navigation menu. Under Core Infrastructure, select **Instaces Pools**. At the far right, click in the three dots ![](images-sandbox/3dots.png " ") and select **Terminate**. Confirm when prompted.

5. Open the navigation menu. Under Core Infrastructure, select **Instaces**. At the far right, click in the three dots ![](images-sandbox/3dots.png " ") and select **Terminate**. Cehck the box **Permanently delete the attached boot volume** and click on **Terminate Instance**.

6. Open the navigation menu. Under Networking, select **Load Balancers**. At the far right, click in the three dots ![](images-sandbox/3dots.png " ") and select **Terminate**. Confirm when prompted.

7. Open the navigation menu. Under Networking, select **Virtual Cloud Networks**. At the far right, click in the three dots ![](images-sandbox/3dots.png " ") and select **Terminate**. Confirm when prompted.

*Congratulations! You have successfully completed the lab.*
