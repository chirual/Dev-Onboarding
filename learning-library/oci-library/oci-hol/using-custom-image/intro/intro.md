# Introduction

In this workshop we will use Custom image feature of OCI. Using this feature an existing Compute instance with software packages and updates installed can be used to created additional compute instance. These new compute instances will come with all the software packages and updates pre-installed.

## About Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Compute Service

Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Compute lets you provision and manage compute hosts, known as instances . You can launch instances as needed to meet your compute and application requirements. After you launch an instance, you can access it securely from your computer, restart it, attach and detach volumes, and terminate it when you're done with it. Any changes made to the instance's local drives are lost when you terminate it. Any saved changes to volumes attached to the instance are retained.
