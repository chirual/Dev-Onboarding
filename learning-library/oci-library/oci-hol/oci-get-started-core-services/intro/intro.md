# Introduction

The labs in this workshop cover an introduction to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Core Services, including virtual cloud networks (VCN), compute and storage services. These labs also provide some of the foundational skills and knowledge you will need to attempt the [Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Foundations Certification](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/iaas/training/foundations.html) offered by Oracle University.

The Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Foundations Certification provides candidates with foundational knowledge of core cloud computing concepts and an understanding of those services in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. The certification is intended for candidates with technical and non-technical backgrounds who want to validate their understanding of Oracle Cloud infrastructure.

The labs featured on this page cover various solutions, skill levels, and categories based on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI).

## About Oracle Cloud Infrastructure

Oracle Cloud Infrastructure is a set of complementary cloud services that enable you to build and run a wide range of applications and services in a highly available hosted environment. Oracle Cloud Infrastructure offers high-performance compute capabilities (as physical hardware instances) and storage capacity in a flexible overlay virtual network that is securely accessible from your on-premises network.
