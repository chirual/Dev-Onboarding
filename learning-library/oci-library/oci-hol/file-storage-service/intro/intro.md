# Introduction

In this workshop you will create and mount File Storage System to a compute instance and verify availability of the File Storage system.

Estimated time: 60 minutes

## File System Storage Service

Oracle Cloud Infrastructure File Storage Service provides a durable, scalable, distributed, enterprise-grade network file system. You can connect to a File Storage Service file system from any bare metal, virtual machine, or container instance in your Virtual Cloud Network (VCN). You can also access a file system from outside the VCN using Oracle Cloud Infrastructure FastConnect and Internet Protocol security (IPSec) virtual private network (VPN).
