# Provisioning your Autonomous Database instance

![Autonomous Databases](./images/adb_banner2.png)

## Introduction

This workshop walks you through the steps to get started using the **Oracle Autonomous Data Warehouse Database (ADW)**. You will provision a new database in just a few minutes.

Oracle Autonomous Databases have the following characteristics:

**Self-driving**
Automates database provisioning, tuning, and scaling.

- Provisions highly available databases, configures and tunes for specific workloads, and scales compute resources when needed, all done automatically.

**Self-securing**
Automates data protection and security.

- Protect sensitive and regulated data automatically, patch your database for security vulnerabilities, and prevent unauthorized access—all with Oracle Autonomous Database.

**Self-repairing**
Automates failure detection, failover, and repair.

- Detect and protect from system failures and user errors automatically and provide failover to standby databases with zero data loss.

Estimated Lab Time: 15 minutes

### Objectives 
- Create an Autonomous Database with the latest features of Oracle Databases

## **STEP 1**: Create a new Autonomous Data Warehouse Database

1. Click on the hamburger **MENU** link at the upper left corner of the page.

    This will produce a drop-down menu, where you should select **Autonomous Data Warehouse.**

    This will take you to the management console page.

    [You can learn more about compartments in this link](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/Tasks/managingcompartments.htm).

2. To create a new instance, click the blue **Create Autonomous Database** button.

    Enter the required information and click the **Create Autonomous Database** button at the bottom of the form. For the purposes of this workshop, use the information below:

    >**Compartment:** Verify that a compartment ( &lt;tenancy_name&gt; ) is selected.

    By default, any OCI tenancy has a default ***root*** compartment, named after the tenancy itself. The tenancy administrator (default root compartment administrator) is any user who is a member of the default Administrators group. For the workshop purpose, you can use ***root***.

    > **Display Name:** Enter the display name for your ADW Instance. For this demo purpose, I have called my database **ADW_OAC**.
    >
    > **Database Name:** Enter any database name you choose that fits the requirements for ADW. The database name must consist of letters and numbers only, starting with a letter. The maximum length is 14 characters. You can leave the name provided. That field is not a mandatory one.
    >
    > **Workload Type:** Autonomous Data Warehouse  
    >
    > **Deployment Type:** Shared Infrastructure
    >
    > **Always Free:** On

    You can select Always Free configuration to start enjoying your Free Autonomous Database. You will have see the Always Free logo next to the name of your database:

    ![Always Free Logo](./images/always_free_logo.png)

    [We have selected 'Always Free Tier On'. To learn more about this option check the following link](https://www.oracle.com/uk/cloud/free/#always-free).

    > **Choose Database version:** 19c
    >
    > **CPU Count:** 1
    >
    > **Storage Capacity (TB):** 0.02
    >
    > **CPU Count and Storage Capacity (TB)** are defined by default for the Always Free Tier.
    >
    > **Auto scaling:** Off

3. Under **Create administration credentials** section:

    > **Administrator Password:** Enter any password you wish to use noting the specific requirements imposed by ADW. A suggested password for this lab is ADWwelcome-1234.
    >
    > **Reminder:** Note your password in a safe location as this cannot be easily reset.

    Under **Choose network access** section:

    > Select **'Allow secure access from everywhere'**: *On*
    >
    > Select **Configure access control rules:** *Off*

4. Under **Choose a license type** section, choose **License Type: Licence Included**.

    When you have completed the required fields, scroll down and click on the blue **Create Autonomous Database** button at the bottom of the form:

    ![ADB Creation](./images/lab100_6.png)

5. The Autonomous Database **Details** page will show information about your new instance. You should notice the various menu buttons that help you manage your new instance -- because the instance is currently being provisioned all the management buttons are greyed out.

6. A summary of your instance status is shown in the large box on the left. In this example, the color is amber and the status is **Provisioning.**

7. After a short while, the status will change to **Available** and the "ADW" box will change color to green:

8. Once the Lifecycle Status is **Available**, additional summary information about your instance is populated, including workload type and other details.

    The provisioning process should take **under 5 minutes**.

9. After having the Autonomous Database instance **created** and **available**, you can get a message window asking you to upgrade from 18c to 19c if you have selected 18c as a database version during the provisioning. You can **upgrade** the database release if you wish after the hands-on session, otherwise the upgrade process can take a **few minutes** and you can miss a few exercises during the session.

    This page is known as the **Autonomous Database Details Page**. It provides you with status information about your database, and its configuration. Get **familiar** with the buttons and tabs on this page.

    Remember: You will have visible the Always Free logo next to the name of your database:

You have just created an Autonomous Database with the latest features of Oracle Databases.

*You can proceed to the next lab…*
